### ðŸŽ¯ Next Immediate Steps

## Sprint 1: Data Consolidation (Week 1)

### Day 1-2: Complete Agent Audit
1. **Run full project audit** using `full-project-audit.html`
2. **Document all existing agents** with their real names, roles, personalities
3. **Identify duplicates** and determine which versions to preserve
4. **Create master agent registry** with consolidated identities

### Day 3-4: Database Architecture
1. **Design clean schema** for consolidated project
2. **Create migration scripts** to import all unique agents
3. **Set up proper RLS policies** for security
4. **Test data integrity** and identity preservation

### Day 5-7: Foundation Code
1. **Create modular client library** for agent interactions
2. **Build authentication system** with proper user management
3. **Implement core chat functionality** with agent personality preservation
4. **Set up development environment** and testing framework

## Sprint 2: Professional Interface (Week 2)

    // Preserve individual personalities while optimizing for collaboration
  }
  
  async facilitateCollaboration(
    team: AgentTeam, 
    humanUser: User, 
    project: Project
  ): Promise<CollaborativeWorkflow> {
    // Coordinate multi-agent work while maintaining individual identities
  }
}
```
